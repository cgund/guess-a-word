# guess-a-word

Basically hang man without the man.  Every letter is represented by a button control object.  A click event handler is registered to each button.  When the form is created, the program reads every line from a dictionary text file, gets each word and stores it in a List collection and then randomly selects, depending on the difficulty level selected, a word for the user to guess.
